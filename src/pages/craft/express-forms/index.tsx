            <h6>The Express Forms plugin has been discontinued.</h6>
            <p>
              It was originally created as a free and reliable form-building
              plugin for Craft CMS when other options were limited. It allowed
              for experimentation and trying different approaches, which was
              challenging to do with Freeform due to legacy constraints. Over
              time, we incorporated new features and improved approaches from
              Express Forms into{' '}
              <SimpleTextLink label="Freeform" to="/craft/freeform" />. With the
              significant rewrite of Freeform 5, we addressed many limitations
              related to extending and custom module development. Now,{' '}
              <SimpleTextLink label="Freeform v5" to="/craft/freeform/v5" />{' '}
              includes three editions: <i>Express</i>, <i>Lite</i>, and{' '}
              <i>Pro</i>. The <i>Express</i> edition of Freeform is free and
              suitable for most small sites that only require a simple contact
              form while offering many additional features and benefits.
