            <p>
              This license is a legal agreement between you and Solspace, Inc.

              terms and conditions of this license. Solspace, Inc. reserves the
              right to alter this agreement at any time, for any reason, without

            <h3 className="mt-8">Permitted Use</h3>
            <p>
              One license grants the right to perform one installation of the

              sandbox servers do not require an additional purchase of a
              license. Each additional installation of the Software on a
              live/production website requires an additional purchased license.
