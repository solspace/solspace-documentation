            <p>
              Solspace offers premium paid support services for its plugins. If
              you have lots of questions or are building something complex, need
              help with a custom module, or have a complicated upgrade, you can
              get direct, high-priority email, chat, or web call access to the
              Solspace Software team.
            </p>

                My experience with Solspace Premium Support was fantastic! They
                contacted me in a matter of minutes and within 30 minutes, I was
                talking to the lead developer. Gustavs was amazing to work with
                and helped me through my issue quickly and efficiently. I can’t
                recommend the Premium Support enough, and will definitely be
                using it in the future when needed.
